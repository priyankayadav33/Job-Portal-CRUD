# Job-Portal-CRUD
This project is a job portal application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and React Native. It allows job seekers to register, search for jobs, and apply, while job providers (recruiters) can post jobs, search for candidates, and manage applications.
